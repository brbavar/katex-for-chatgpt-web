# KaTeX for ChatGPT

Whenever ChatGPT and I talk math or logic with each other, and it starts sending me beautifully rendered notation, 
I begin to wish I could do the same—not for the sake of aesthetics so much as concisely and precisely expressing 
concepts. Of course, GPT can read any TeX code in your messages, regardless of whether the notation is rendered on your screen. But you, as a human being, are not as comfortable reading TeX code as AI is, even if you know how to write it—and you'd better know how if you want to use this extension. So if you use TeX in a conversation about math with GPT, and then return to that conversation a few days later, you're going to have a hard time understanding what you wrote (except indirectly, by looking at GPT's more readable response, which is bound to either reiterate what you said or convey the gist of it).

So I made that wish come true. With this Chrome extension you can now send rendered mathematical formulas to GPT, courtesy of KaTeX.
